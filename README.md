# PROJECT WORKFLOW

Chrome Extension: You’ll need to build an extension that can access YouTube’s web content (the Shorts feed) and analyze it.
AI Integration: The AI component can use machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) to categorize the content based on visible metadata like titles, descriptions, or video content.
Legal and Ethical Considerations: Ensure the extension adheres to YouTube’s Terms of Service and Google’s policies. Do not collect personal data without user consent, and ensure that any data collected is for analysis purposes only.

# Development of the Chrome Extension

		1. Manifest File (manifest.json): Defines the permissions and settings. You need access to   the YouTube page.
            		2. Content Script: This script will inject JavaScript into YouTube’s Shorts page to access and scrape the required content (titles, descriptions, etc.)
            		3. Background Script: Handles processing of data and AI-based categorization.
            
# AI Integration 

		1. Machine Learning Model: You can use models trained on video metadata to categorize content. Categories could include humor, music, sports, education, etc.
			•Use a pre-trained model from a service like TensorFlow.js or Hugging Face to quickly categorize text-based data (e.g., titles, descriptions).
			•Optionally, fine-tune the model for specific content categories relevant to YouTube Shorts.
           
# AI Training Data

		1. Dataset: You’ll need a dataset of YouTube titles and descriptions categorized into different content types. You can find datasets online or build your own.
	      	2. Training: Use a service like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn to train a text classification model.
			•NLP techniques such as BERT or TF-IDF can be useful for categorizing short-form content.
			•If video analysis is necessary, more complex models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to process video frames or thumbnails.


# Deployment of AI Model

		1. Once the model is trained:
				• Export it as a TensorFlow.js or Hugging Face model and include it in the Chrome extension’s background script.
				•When the content script retrieves video titles, pass them to the background script for categorization.

# Display Result
1. Use a popup or new tab in the Chrome extension to display categorized data:

# Extension Test
		
		1. Install the Extension Locally: You can test your extension by loading it as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
			2. Testing: Make sure the AI model categorizes content as expected, and that the extension functions smoothly without breaching YouTube’s policies.

# Legal & Ethical Considerations:
	•	User Privacy: Clearly inform users about the data being accessed (e.g., video titles). Avoid scraping personal data.
	•	Compliance: Ensure compliance with YouTube’s API Terms of Service and Google’s Chrome Web Store Developer Policies to avoid suspension.
